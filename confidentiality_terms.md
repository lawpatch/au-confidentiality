## Confidentiality

**General obligation of confidentiality**

- Disclosing Party may disclose Confidential Information to Recipient at the discretion of Disclosing Party.
- Recipient agrees to use the Confidential Information solely for the Purpose.
- Recipient agrees to keep the Confidential Information strictly confidential.

**Standard of confidentiality**

Recipient agrees to:
- use industry standard security techniques to prevent;
- immediately notify Disclosing Party of;
- comply with Disclosing Party's reasonable instructions regarding; and
- use its best endeavours to mitigate the effects of,

any unauthorised access to or use of the Confidential Information for which Recipient is responsible in whole or in part.

**Permitted disclosures**

- Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to professional advisors, employees, agents and contractors, but only to the extent necessary for the Purpose.
- Recipient is also permitted to disclose Confidential Information if:
	- the disclosure is necessary in order to enforce the Agreement;
	- the disclosure is required by law or a binding order of a government agency or court, but
Recipient must not make such a disclosure without first notifying Disclosing Party and giving Disclosing Party a reasonable opportunity to object to the disclosure. 
- Recipient must comply with Disclosing Party's reasonable requests with regard to any permitted disclosure.
- Recipient must use reasonable endeavours to ensure any person receiving the Confidential Information through a permitted disclosure will treat it confidentially, and under substantially the same obligations as the Confidentiality Obligations.

**Exceptions**

Where there is an Exception, the Confidentiality Obligations will not apply to the extent of the Exception.

**Damages not an adequate remedy**

- The parties agree that:
	- the value of the Confidential Information is difficult to assess; and 
	- damages would not be an adequate remedy for the irreparable harm that would be caused by the Recipient's breach of the Confidentiality Obligations.
- If Recipient actually breaches or threatens to breach the Confidentiality Obligations, Disclosing Party will be entitled to enforce Recipient's Confidentiality Obligations by injunctive relief or specific performance, in addition to any other available remedy. The Disclosing Party will not be required to prove actual or special damage in order to do so.

**Interpretation**

The Confidentiality Obligations may be mutual so that, if specified in the Provision, each party to the Agreement may simultaneously be a Disclosing Party with respect to its own Confidential Information and a Recipient with respect to another party's Confidential Information.
