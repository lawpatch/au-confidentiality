- use its best endeavours to mitigate the effects of,

any unauthorised access or use of the Confidential Information for which it is responsible in whole or in part.

**Permitted disclosures**

- Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to professional advisors, employees, agents and contractors, but only to the extent necessary for the Purpose.
- Recipient is also permitted to disclose Confidential Information if:
	- the disclosure is necessary in order to enforce the Agreement;

Recipient must not make such a disclosure without first notifying Disclosing and giving Disclosing Party a reasonable opportunity to object to the disclosure.
